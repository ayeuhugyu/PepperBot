## a lotta prompt changes (yes this is like the 4th time i've rewritten this system)
$SPLIT$
added some new models:
- `gpt-5-mini`: openai's latest reasoning model, wayyyy faster than previous iterations
- `mistral-small-2`: i'm testing out mistral models here, in my experience they seem to be better with casual conversations. this might end up being useless, but we'll have to see.
